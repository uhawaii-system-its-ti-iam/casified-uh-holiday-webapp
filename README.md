# casified-uh-holiday-webapp
Retool Frank's UH Holiday web app for React and CAS.  The initial purpose of this app is to provide the team with React experience before embarking on the UH Groupings 3.0 Epic.  The longer term purpose of this app is to provide new team members with a straightforward example of how the various frameworks used for the UH Groupings project interrelate.
